# The Odin Project Signup Form

A mockup signup page made from scratch. This project belongs to [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/calculator) curriculum.


##  What I learned during this project:

- how to use different techniques in CSS to style and position elements on a page
- design principles (for example, using color palettes lifted from images for a consistent look)
- using form elements and styling them
- rudimentary form validation both with CSS and JS
